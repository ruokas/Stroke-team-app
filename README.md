# Stroke Team App

A lightweight web application for stroke teams to quickly record and
track critical information during patient treatment. The interface is
optimized for rapid data entry, offers builtâ€‘in calculators and summaries,
and stores drafts locally so it can be used offline.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 20 or later.

Install dependencies and run the tests:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

To build optimized assets run:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Database migrations

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and run migrations with:

```sh
npm run migrate
```

## Real-time collaboration

The app ships with a small WebSocket server that syncs form data between browsers.

### Starting the server

```sh
npm start
```

By default the server listens on `ws://localhost:3000/ws`. Set the `PORT` environment variable to use a different port:

```sh
PORT=4000 npm start
```

Leave the server running while using the app.

### Joining a collaboration room

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click the **Collaborate** button in the header.
3. Enter a room ID and press **Join**. All clients that join the same room receive real-time updates.

### Troubleshooting

* Ensure the WebSocket server is running and the port matches the one used by the frontend.
* Firewalls or corporate networks may block WebSocket connections; try a different network if you cannot connect.
* When served over HTTPS the app uses `wss://`; if the server only provides `ws://`, run it behind an HTTPS proxy or access the app over HTTP.
* Check the browser console for additional error details.

## Offline support

The app registers a Service Worker that caches the core HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and locale files so the interface continues to work offline after the first
load.

## Draft storage schema

Drafts saved to `localStorage` are wrapped in an object with a `version`
number. The current schema version is **1**, stored as
`{ version: 1, data: <payload> }`. Older drafts without a version are
automatically migrated when loaded.
