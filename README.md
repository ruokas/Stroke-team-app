# Stroke Team App

A lightweight web application for stroke teams to quickly record and
track critical information during patient treatment. The interface is
optimized for rapid data entry, offers builtâ€‘in calculators and summaries,
and stores drafts locally so it can be used offline.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and run the tests:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

To build optimized assets run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Open `index.html` in a browser to use the app.

## Draft storage schema

Drafts saved to `localStorage` are wrapped in an object with a `version`
number. The current schema version is **1**, stored as
`{ version: 1, data: <payload> }`. Older drafts without a version are
automatically migrated when loaded.
